*EXAMPLE 
                        FIREBALL 
AttackIce mob           AttackFire mob          AttackAir mob 
change efficiency       Effect Shape            Increase Intensity 
    - more heat             - Change color          - more power / small size 
    - less power            - Change power          - same mana cost 
    - less mana cost        - More mana cost        - longer cast time 

 
*DIAGRAM EXPLAINED 
top =  Skill 
second = event/action/trigger for change 
third = skill modifications that will be affected by event and weighted to determine effect applied 
third '-' =  example of this to affect of a skill 
    

Use different weighted values that when all added together equal a value then 
modiffies an skill using those weights or uses a predetermined modifications 
and removes chances for other modifications as an option 

  
maybe something like 
    -  efficiency = 2.1 
    -  power = 1.04 
    -  learning = 2.9 
        - size = 2 
        - shape = .9

Adds up to 5 (efficiency + power + learning = 5) requirements to calculate is 
to kill a mob (maybe requirements) 
2.1 + 1.04 + 2.9 = 5.19 
  

Current Skill - Fireball  
    - damage = 25 
    - mana cost = 15 
    - size = 1x1 
    - shape = circle   

Apply weights - Fireball 
    - damage = 27.8 
    - mana cost = 13 
    - size = 1.3x1.3 
    - shape = circle 

 
* weights values calculated first 
Formula (damage) = (Spell value * (weighted Value + 1)) - (Spell Value * (1 - weighted Value))
